# GET IN 
YOUR OWN PASSWORD MANAGER

I engineered a MERN Stack Password Manager App, implementing comprehensive registration and authentication mechanisms to ensure secure user access.

The application supports efficient CRUD operations for managing credentials, providing a seamless user experience while maintaining robust data security.

for starting the app: just type  "npm run dev"

for starting the server: 
  1.type cd backend (go in the backend folder)
  2.type "node --watch server.js"
